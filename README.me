# product.tech - ETH Istanbul 2023

## Description of the project

ProductTech is redefining the way we invest in and support new products and startups. Positioned as a unique betting and financial layer on top of Product Hunt, our platform opens the doors to investment opportunities for a wide audience. By creating a decentralized and permissionless prediction market, ProductTech enables users to financially back their belief in a product or startup from its early stages.

Whether it's an innovative solo project or a groundbreaking startup, users can submit any Product Hunt link to generate a dedicated Product page. This page transforms into an investment hub. Here, participants engage in two ways: 

They can hold a 'key' to earn a share of the trading fees, symbolizing an ongoing investment in the product’s success, or they can sell this key to capitalize on the product’s growth. 

In addition to participant earnings, a portion of the trading fees also directly benefits the product itself, contributing to its financial growth and sustainability. Product-specific wallets, claimable by product owners, facilitate this unique revenue-sharing model.

ProductTech isn’t just a platform for product fans; it's an exhilarating trading arena. Merging the thrill of the market with the support for innovative products, we offer traders an engaging way to invest in potential.

It's where passion for progress meets smart investment strategy, empowering everyone in the journey of shaping tomorrow's breakthroughs.
